## What is a key-logger ?

A key-logger is a computer program, used to capture/track the keys press on a computer key-board.

A key-logger often runs in background, whilst the user is oblivious to it.
Key-loggers can be very dangerous as they mostly are used to attain a victim's credentials and other confidential data.
